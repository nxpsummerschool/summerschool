Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The Multicore eRPC Two Way RPC RTOS project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board jumper settings and
configurations in default state when running this demo.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (P6) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the eRPC Two Way RPC RTOS demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Primary core started
Copy CORE1 image to address: 0x20033000, size: 32780
Get number from core1:
Got number: 1

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note:
The "Copy CORE1 image to address..." log message is not displayed on the terminal window when MCUXpresso IDE is used.
In case of MCUXpresso IDE the secondary core image is copied to the target memory during startup automatically.
