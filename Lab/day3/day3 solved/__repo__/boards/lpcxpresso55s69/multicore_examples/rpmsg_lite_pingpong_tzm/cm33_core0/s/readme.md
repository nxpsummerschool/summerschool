# rpmsg_lite_pingpong_tzm

## Overview

The Multicore RPMsg-Lite pingpong TZM project is a simple demonstration program that uses the
MCUXpresso SDK software and the RPMsg-Lite library and shows how to implement the inter-core
communication between cores in the TrustZone-M (TZM) environment.

The TZM is configured in the BOARD_InitTrustZone() function. The secondary core is put into
the secure domain as well as the shared memory for RPMsg messages exchange.

The primary core boots in the secure domain, it releases the secondary core from the reset and then the inter-core
communication is established in the secure domain.

Once the RPMsg is initialized and the secure endpoint is created the message exchange starts, incrementing a
virtual counter that is part of the message payload.

The message pingpong in the secure domain finishes when the counter reaches the value of 50.
Then the secure domain is kept running and the non-secure portion of the application is started.
The non-secure RPMsg-Lite endpoint is created in the non-secure domain and the new message
pingpong is triggered, exchanging data between the secondary core secure endpoint and the primary core 
non-secure endpoint.

Veneer functions defined in the secure project are called from the non-secure
domain during this process.
This message pingpong finishes when the counter reaches the value of 1050.
Debug prints from the non-secure portion of the application are routed into the secure domain using
the dedicated veneer function.

## Shared memory usage

This multicore example uses the shared memory for data exchange.
The shared memory region is defined and the size can be adjusted in the linker file.
The shared memory region start address and the size have to be defined in linker file for each core equally.
The shared memory start address is then exported from the linker to the application.
The shared memory assignment to the secure domain is done in the BOARD_InitTrustZone() function.

## Building the application

This shows example how to build application for `frdmmcxn947` board with `cm33_core0` core_id.
Change the `-b <board>` parameter based on board you want to build.
Change the `-Dcore_id=<core_id>` parameter based on board core you want to build.
For these parameters please see attribute `boards:` in `primary/example.yml`.

```
west build --sysbuild examples/multicore_examples/rpmsg_lite_pingpong_tzm/primary --toolchain armgcc --config debug -b frdmmcxn947 -Dcore_id=cm33_core0
```
